Calvin's custom keymap
======================

This keymap is based off the `default` keymap with a few modifications.

- ESC and TAB keys switched.
- PWR is added next to RESET, on the \_ADJUST layer
- F14 and F15 for OSX screen brightness in the \_LOWER layer
- Removed NXT and PLAY keys in \_LOWER, shifted VOL all the way to the right
- NXT changed to MUTE in the \_RAISE layer
